# Installation

To install, copy all folders to the main Neverwinter Nights directory. See the last section below for where each file in the Duality folder should be placed within the Neverwinter Nights directory.

> If installing from GitHub, the "aa_1.1tilesetpak.HAK", "DualityFinal.hak", "DualityMusic.hak" and "DualityHub1.hak" hak packs are an additional required download which can be obtained [here](http://www.ualberta.ca/~atcheung/downloads/CMPUT_250_Duality/).

# Instructions

Start the game by loading the "Duality" module and selecting the "Mia" pre-made
character. Open the Inventory by pressing "I" and the Journal by pressing "J". 
The Journal contains information about Mia's story as the game progresses, and
may prove useful to help solve the puzzles in each of the rooms. 

> WEARING A HEADSET IS A PREREQUISITE TO ENJOYING THE GAME
